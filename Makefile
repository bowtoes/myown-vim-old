# Makefile for Vim on Unix and Unix-like systems	vim:ts=8:sw=8:tw=78
#
# This Makefile is loosely based on the GNU Makefile conventions found in
# standards.info.
#
# Compiling Vim, summary:
#
#	3. make
#	5. make install
#
# Compiling Vim, details:
#
# Edit this file for adjusting to your system. You should not need to edit any
# other file for machine specific things!
# The name of this file MUST be Makefile (note the uppercase 'M').
#
# 1. Edit this Makefile  {{{1
#	The defaults for Vim should work on most machines, but you may want to
#	uncomment some lines or make other changes below to tune it to your
#	system, compiler or preferences.  Uncommenting means that the '#' in
#	the first column of a line is removed.
#	- If you want a version of Vim that is small and starts up quickly,
#	  you might want to disable the GUI, X11, Perl, Python and Tcl.
#	- Uncomment the line with --disable-gui if you have Motif, GTK and/or
#	  Athena but don't want to make gvim (the GUI version of Vim with nice
#	  menus and scrollbars, but makes Vim bigger and startup slower).
#	- Uncomment --disable-darwin if on Mac OS X but you want to compile a
#	  Unix version.
#	- Uncomment the line "CONF_OPT_X = --without-x" if you have X11 but
#	  want to disable using X11 libraries.	This speeds up starting Vim,
#	  but the window title will not be set and the X11 selection can not
#	  be used.
#	- Uncomment the line "CONF_OPT_XSMP = --disable-xsmp" if you have the
#	  X11 Session Management Protocol (XSMP) library (libSM) but do not
#	  want to use it.
#	  This can speedup Vim startup but Vim loses the ability to catch the
#	  user logging out from session-managers like GNOME and work
#	  could be lost.
#	- Uncomment one or more of these lines to include an interface;
#	  each makes Vim quite a bit bigger:
#		--enable-luainterp	for Lua interpreter
#		--enable-mzschemeinterp	for MzScheme interpreter
#		--enable-perlinterp	for Perl interpreter
#		--enable-python3interp	for Python3 interpreter
#		--enable-pythoninterp	for Python interpreter
#		--enable-rubyinterp	for Ruby interpreter
#		--enable-tclinterp	for Tcl interpreter
#		--enable-cscope		for Cscope interface
#	- Uncomment one of the lines with --with-features= to enable a set of
#	  features (but not the interfaces just mentioned).
#	- Uncomment the line with --disable-acl to disable ACL support even
#	  though your system supports it.
#	- Uncomment the line with --disable-gpm to disable gpm support
#	  even though you have gpm libraries and includes.
#	- Uncomment the line with --disable-sysmouse to disable sysmouse
#	  support even though you have /dev/sysmouse and includes.
#	- Uncomment one of the lines with CFLAGS and/or CC if you have
#	  something very special or want to tune the optimizer.
#	- Search for the name of your system to see if it needs anything
#	  special.
#	- A few versions of make use '.include "file"' instead of 'include
#	  file'.  Adjust the include line below if yours does.
#
# 2. Edit feature.h  {{{1
#	Only if you do not agree with the default compile features, e.g.:
#	- you want Vim to be as vi compatible as it can be
#	- you want to use Emacs tags files
#	- you want right-to-left editing (Hebrew)
#	- you want 'langmap' support (Greek)
#	- you want to remove features to make Vim smaller
#
# 3. "make"  {{{1
#	Will first run ./configure with the options in this file. Then it will
#	start make again on this Makefile to do the compiling. You can also do
#	this in two steps with:
#		make config
#		make
#	The configuration phase creates/overwrites auto/config.h and
#	auto/config.mk.
#	The configure script is created with "make autoconf".  It can detect
#	different features of your system and act accordingly.  However, it is
#	not correct for all systems.  Check this:
#	- If you have X windows, but configure could not find it or reported
#	  another include/library directory then you wanted to use, you have
#	  to set CONF_OPT_X below.  You might also check the installation of
#	  xmkmf.
#	- If you have --enable-gui=motif and have Motif on your system, but
#	  configure reports "checking for location of gui... <not found>", you
#	  have to set GUI_INC_LOC and GUI_LIB_LOC below.
#	If you changed something, do this to run configure again:
#		make reconfig
#
#	- If you do not trust the automatic configuration code, then inspect
#	  auto/config.h and auto/config.mk, before starting the actual build
#	  phase. If possible edit this Makefile, rather than auto/config.mk --
#	  especially look at the definition of VIMLOC below. Note that the
#	  configure phase overwrites auto/config.mk and auto/config.h again.
#	- If you get error messages, find out what is wrong and try to correct
#	  it in this Makefile. You may need to do "make reconfig" when you
#	  change anything that configure uses (e.g. switching from an old C
#	  compiler to an ANSI C compiler). Only when auto/configure does
#	  something wrong you may need to change one of the other files. If
#	  you find a clean way to fix the problem, consider sending a note to
#	  the author of autoconf (bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu) or Vim
#	  (Bram@vim.org). Don't bother to do that when you made a hack
#	  solution for a non-standard system.
#
# 4. "make test"  {{{1
#	This is optional.  This will run Vim scripts on a number of test
#	files, and compare the produced output with the expected output.
#	If all is well, you will get the "ALL DONE" message in the end.  If a
#	test fails you get "TEST FAILURE".  See below (search for "/^test").
#
# 5. "make install"  {{{1
#	If the new Vim seems to be working OK you can install it and the
#	documentation in the appropriate location. The default is
#	"/usr/local".  Change "prefix" below to change the location.
#	"auto/pathdef.c" will be compiled again after changing this to make
#	the executable know where the help files are located.
#	Note that any existing executable is removed or overwritten.  If you
#	want to keep it you will have to make a backup copy first.
#	The runtime files are in a different directory for each version.  You
#	might want to delete an older version.
#	If you don't want to install everything, there are other targets:
#		make installvim		only installs Vim, not the tools
#		make installvimbin	only installs the Vim executable
#		make installruntime	installs most of the runtime files
#		make installrtbase	only installs the Vim help and
#							runtime files
#		make installlinks	only installs the Vim binary links
#		make installmanlinks	only installs the Vim manpage links
#		make installmacros	only installs the Vim macros
#		make installpack	only installs the packages
#		make installtutorbin	only installs the Vim tutor program
#		make installtutor	only installs the Vim tutor files
#		make installspell	only installs the spell files
#		make installtools	only installs xxd
#	If you install Vim, not to install for real but to prepare a package
#	or RPM, set DESTDIR to the root of the tree.
#
# 6. Use Vim until a new version comes out.  {{{1
#
# 7. "make uninstall_runtime"  {{{1
#	Will remove the runtime files for the current version.	This is safe
#	to use while another version is being used, only version-specific
#	files will be deleted.
#	To remove the runtime files of another version:
#		make uninstall_runtime VIMRTDIR=/vim54
#	If you want to delete all installed files, use:
#		make uninstall
#	Note that this will delete files that have the same name for any
#	version, thus you might need to do a "make install" soon after this.
#	Be careful not to remove a version of Vim that is still being used!
#	To find out which files and directories will be deleted, use:
#		make -n uninstall
# }}}

# (*)  Remarks: {{{
#
# (1)  Uncomment line below for shlicc2
# (2)  HPUX with compile problems or wrong digraphs, uncomment line below
# (3)  Infomagic Motif needs GUI_LIB_LOC and GUI_INC_LOC set, see below.
#      And add "-lXpm" to MOTIF_LIBS2.
# (4)  For cc the optimizer must be disabled (use CFLAGS= after running
#      configure) (symptom: ":set termcap" output looks weird).
# (5)  Compiler may need extra argument, see below.
# (6)  See below for a few lines to uncomment
# (7)  See below for lines which enable the use of clcc
# (8)  Needs some EXTRA_LIBS, search for Unisys below
# (9)  Needs an extra compiler flag to compile gui_at_sb.c, see below.
# (A)  May need EXTRA_LIBS, see below
# (B)  Can't compile GUI because there is no waitpid()...  Disable GUI below.
# (C)  Force the use of curses instead of termcap, see below.
# (D)  Uncomment lines below for QNX
# (E)  You might want to use termlib instead of termcap, see below.
# (F)  See below for instructions.
# (G)  Using ncurses version 4.2 has reported to cause a crash.  Use the
#      Sun curses library instead.
# (H)  See line for EXTRA_LIBS below.
# (I)  SINIX-N 5.42 and 5.43 need some EXTRA_LIBS.  Also for Reliant-Unix.
# (J)  If you get undefined symbols, see below for a solution.
# (K)  See lines to uncomment below for machines with 64 bit pointers.
# (L)  For Silicon Graphics O2 workstations remove "-lnsl" from auto/config.mk
# (M)  gcc version cygnus-2.0.1 does NOT work (symptom: "dl" deletes two
#      characters instead of one).
# (N)  SCO with decmouse.
# (O)  LynxOS needs EXTRA_LIBS, see below.
# (P)  For SuperUX 6.2 on NEC SX-4 see a few lines below to uncomment.
# (Q)  For UNIXSVR 4.2MP on NEC UP4800 see below for lines to uncomment.
# (R)  For Solaris 2.5 (or 2.5.1) with gcc > 2.5.6, uncomment line below.
# (S)  For Irix 6.x with MipsPro compiler, use -OPT:Olimit.  See line below.
# (T)  See ../doc/os_beos.txt.
# (U)  Must uncomment CONF_OPT_PYTHON option below to disable Python
#      detection, since the configure script runs into an error when it
#      detects Python (probably because of the bash shell).
# (V)  See lines to uncomment below.
# (X)  Need to use the .include "auto/config.mk" line below
# (Y)  See line with c89 below
# (Z)  See lines with cc or c89 below
# (a)  See line with EXTRA_LIBS below.
# (b)  When using gcc with the Solaris linker, make sure you don't use GNU
#      strip, otherwise the binary may not run: "Cannot find ELF".
# (c)  Add -lfloss to EXTRA_LIBS, see below.
# (x)  When you get warnings for precompiled header files, run
#      "sudo fixPrecomps".  Also see CONF_OPT_DARWIN below.

#####################################################
###  Specific systems, check if yours is listed!  ### {{{
#####################################################

### Uncomment things here only if the values chosen by configure are wrong.
### It's better to adjust configure.ac and "make autoconf", if you can!
### Then send the required changes to configure.ac to the bugs list.

### (1) BSD/OS 2.0.1, 2.1 or 3.0 using shared libraries
###
#CC = shlicc2
#CFLAGS = -O2 -g -m486 -Wall -Wshadow -Wmissing-prototypes -fno-builtin

### (2) HP-UX with a non-ANSI cc, use the c89 ANSI compiler
###	The first probably works on all systems
###	The second should work a bit better on newer systems
###	The third should work a bit better on HPUX 11.11
###	Information provided by: Richard Allen <ra@rhi.hi.is>
#CC = c89 -D_HPUX_SOURCE
#CC = c89 -O +Onolimit +ESlit -D_HPUX_SOURCE
#CC = c89 -O +Onolimit +ESlit +e -D_HPUX_SOURCE

### (2) For HP-UX: Enable the use of a different set of digraphs.  Use this
###	when the default (ISO) digraphs look completely wrong.
###	After changing this do "touch digraph.c; make".
#EXTRA_DEFS = -DHPUX_DIGRAPHS

### (2) For HP-UX: 9.04 cpp default macro definition table of 128000 bytes
###	is too small to compile many routines.	It produces too much defining
###	and no space errors.
###	Uncomment the following to specify a larger macro definition table.
#CFLAGS = -Wp,-H256000

### (2) For HP-UX 10.20 using the HP cc, with X11R6 and Motif 1.2, with
###	libraries in /usr/lib instead of /lib (avoiding transition links).
###	Information provided by: David Green
#XROOT = /usr
#CONF_OPT_X = --x-include=$(XROOT)/include/X11R6 --x-libraries=$(XROOT)/lib/X11R6
#GUI_INC_LOC = -I/usr/include/Motif1.2

###     AIX with c89 (Walter Briscoe)
#CC = c89
#CPPFLAGS = -D_ALL_SOURCE

###     AIX 4.3.3.12 with xic 3.6.6 (David R. Favor)
#       needed to avoid a problem where strings.h gets included
#CFLAGS = -qsrcmsg -O2 -qmaxmem=8192 -D__STR31__

### (W) Solaris with multi-threaded libraries (-lthread):

### (7) Solaris 2.4/2.5 with Centerline compiler
#CC = clcc
#X_LIBS_DIR = -L/usr/openwin/lib -R/usr/openwin/lib
#CFLAGS = -O

### (9) Solaris 2.x with cc (SunPro), using Athena.
###	Only required for compiling gui_at_sb.c.
###	Symptom: "identifier redeclared: vim_XawScrollbarSetThumb"
###	Use one of the lines (either Full ANSI or no ANSI at all)
#CFLAGS = $(CFLAGS) -Xc
#CFLAGS = $(CFLAGS) -Xs

### Solaris 2.3 with X11 and specific cc
#CC=/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc -O -Xa -v -R/usr/openwin/lib

### Solaris with /usr/ucb/cc (it is rejected by autoconf as "cc")
#CC	    = /usr/ucb/cc
#EXTRA_LIBS = -R/usr/ucblib

### Solaris with Forte Developer and NetBeans.
# The Xpm library is available from http://koala.ilog.fr/ftp/pub/xpm.

#EXTRA_DEFS	= -xCC -DHAVE_X11_XPM_H

### (R) for Solaris 2.5 (or 2.5.1) with gcc > 2.5.6 you might need this:
#LDFLAGS = -lw -ldl -lXmu
#GUI_LIB_LOC = -L/usr/local/lib

### (8) Unisys 6035 (Glauber Ribeiro)
#EXTRA_LIBS = -lnsl -lsocket -lgen

### When builtin functions cause problems with gcc (for Sun 4.1.x)
#CFLAGS = -O2 -Wall -traditional -Wno-implicit

### Apollo DOMAIN (with SYSTYPE = bsd4.3) (TESTED for version 3.0)
#EXTRA_DEFS = -DDOMAIN

### (A)  Some versions of SCO Open Server 5 (Jan Christiaan van Winkel)
###	 Also use the CONF_TERM_LIB below!
#EXTRA_LIBS = -lgen

### (D)  QNX (by G.F. Desrochers)
#CFLAGS = -g -O -mf -4

### (F)  QNX (by John Oleynick)
# 1. If you don't have an X server: Comment out CONF_OPT_GUI and uncomment
#    CONF_OPT_X = --without-x.
# 2. make config
# 3. edit auto/config.mk and remove -ldir and -ltermcap from LIBS.  It doesn't
#	have -ldir (does config find it somewhere?) and -ltermcap has at
#	least one problem so I use termlib.o instead.  The problem with
#	termcap is that it segfaults if you call it with the name of
#	a non-existent terminal type.
# 4. edit auto/config.h and add #define USE_TMPNAM
# 5. add termlib.o to OBJ
# 6. make

### (H)  for Data general DG/UX 5.4.2 and 5.4R3.10 (Jonas J. Schlein)
#EXTRA_LIBS = -lgen

### (I) SINIX-N 5.42 or 5.43 RM400 R4000 (also SINIX-Y and SINIX-Z)
#EXTRA_LIBS = -lgen -lnsl
###   For SINIX-Y this is needed for the right prototype of gettimeofday()
#EXTRA_DEFS = -D_XPG_IV

### (I) Reliant-Unix (aka SINIX) 5.44 with standard cc
#	Use both "-F O3" lines for optimization or the "-g" line for debugging
#EXTRA_LIBS = -lgen -lsocket -lnsl -lSM -lICE
#CFLAGS = -F O3 -DSINIXN
#LDFLAGS = -F O3
#CFLAGS = -g -DSINIXN

### (P)  SCO 3.2.42, with different termcap names for some useful keys DJB
#EXTRA_DEFS = -DSCOKEYS -DNETTERM_MOUSE -DDEC_MOUSE -DXTERM_MOUSE -DHAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY
#EXTRA_LIBS = -lsocket -ltermcap -lmalloc -lc_s

### (P)  SuperUX 6.2 on NEC SX-4 (Lennart Schultz)
#GUI_INC_LOC = -I/usr/include
#GUI_LIB_LOC = -L/usr/lib
#EXTRA_LIBS = -lgen

### (Q) UNIXSVR 4.2MP on NEC UP4800 (Lennart Schultz)
#GUI_INC_LOC = -I/usr/necccs/include
#GUI_LIB_LOC = -L/usr/necccs/lib/X11R6
#XROOT = /usr/necccs
#CONF_OPT_X = --x-include=$(XROOT)/include --x-libraries=$(XROOT)/lib/X11R6
#EXTRA_LIBS = -lsocket -lgen

### Irix 4.0 & 5.2 (Silicon Graphics Machines, __sgi will be defined)
# Not needed for Irix 5.3, Ives Aerts reported
#EXTRA_LIBS = -lmalloc -lc_s
# Irix 4.0, when regexp and regcmp cannot be found when linking:
#EXTRA_LIBS = -lmalloc -lc_s -lPW

### (S) Irix 6.x (MipsPro compiler): Uses different Olimit flag:
# Note:	This newer option style is used with the MipsPro compilers ONLY if
#	you are compiling an "n32" or "64" ABI binary (use either a -n32
#	flag or a -64 flag for CFLAGS).  If you explicitly use a -o32 flag,
#	then the CFLAGS option format will be the typical style (i.e.
#	-Olimit 3000).
#CFLAGS = -OPT:Olimit=3000 -O

### (S) Irix 6.5 with MipsPro C compiler.  Try this as a test to see new
#	compiler features!  Beware, the optimization is EXTREMELY thorough
#	and takes quite a long time.
# Note: See the note above.  Here, the -mips3 option automatically
#	enables either the "n32" or "64" ABI, depending on what machine you
#	are compiling on (n32 is explicitly enabled here, just to make sure).
#CFLAGS = -OPT:Olimit=3500 -O -n32 -mips3 -IPA:aggr_cprop=ON -INLINE:dfe=ON:list=ON:must=screen_char,out_char,ui_write,out_flush
#LDFLAGS= -OPT:Olimit=3500 -O -n32 -mips3 -IPA:aggr_cprop=ON -INLINE:dfe=ON:list=ON:must=screen_char,out_char,ui_write,out_flush

### (K) for SGI Irix machines with 64 bit pointers ("uname -s" says IRIX64)
###	Suggested by Jon Wright <jon@gate.sinica.edu.tw>.
###	Tested on R8000 IRIX6.1 Power Indigo2.
###	Check /etc/compiler.defaults for your compiler settings.
# either (for 64 bit pointers) uncomment the following line
#GUI_LIB_LOC = -L/usr/lib64
# then
# 1) make config
# 2) edit auto/config.mk and delete the -lelf entry in the LIBS line
# 3) make
#
# or (for 32bit pointers) uncomment the following line
#EXTRA_DEFS = -n32
#GUI_LIB_LOC = -L/usr/lib32
# then
# 1) make config
# 2) edit auto/config.mk, add -n32 to LDFLAGS
# 3) make
#
#Alternatively: use -o32 instead of -n32.
###

### (C)  On SCO Unix v3.2.5 (and probably other versions) the termcap library,
###	 which is found by configure, doesn't work correctly.  Symptom is the
###	 error message "Termcap entry too long".  Uncomment the next line.
###	 On AIX 4.2.1 (and other versions probably), libtermcap is reported
###	 not to display properly.
### after changing this, you need to do "make reconfig".
#CONF_TERM_LIB = --with-tlib=curses

#EXTRA_LIBS = -lfloss

### If you want to use ncurses library instead of the automatically found one
### after changing this, you need to do "make reconfig".
#CONF_TERM_LIB = --with-tlib=ncurses

### For GCC on MS-Windows, the ".exe" suffix will be added.
#EXEEXT = .exe
#LNKEXT = .exe

### (O)  For LynxOS 2.5.0, tested on PC.
#EXTRA_LIBS = -lXext -lSM -lICE -lbsd
###	 For LynxOS 3.0.1, tested on PPC
#EXTRA_LIBS= -lXext -lSM -lICE -lnetinet -lXmu -liberty -lX11
###	 For LynxOS 3.1.0, tested on PC
#EXTRA_LIBS= -lXext -lSM -lICE -lnetinet -lXmu


### (V)  For CX/UX 6.2	(on Harris/Concurrent NightHawk 4800, 5800). Remove
###	 -Qtarget if only in a 5800 environment.  (Kipp E. Howard)
#CFLAGS = -O -Qtarget=m88110compat
#EXTRA_LIBS = -lgen

# The value of QUOTESED comes from auto/config.mk.

# Note:
# - DO NOT RUN autoconf MANUALLY!  It will overwrite ./configure instead of
#   producing auto/configure.
# - autoconf is not run automatically, because a patch usually changes both
#   configure.ac and auto/configure but can't update the timestamps.  People
#   who do not have (the correct version of) autoconf would run into trouble.
#
# Two tricks are required to make autoconf put its output in the "auto" dir:
# - Temporarily move the ./configure script to ./configure.save.  Don't
#   overwrite it, it's probably the result of an aborted autoconf.
# - Use sed to change ./config.log to auto/config.log in the configure script.
# Autoconf 2.5x (2.59 at least) produces a few more files that we need to take
# care of:
# - configure.lineno: has the line numbers replaced with $LINENO.  That
#   improves patches a LOT, thus use it instead (until someone says it doesn't
#   work on some system).
# - autom4te.cache directory is created and not cleaned up.  Delete it.
# - Uses ">config.log" instead of "./config.log".
